## Course description

This is the course syllabus for Intermediate Statistics, Spring 2020. Continuous outcomes that meet the assumptions of ordinary least squares regression are relatively rare in the social sciences. This course focuses our attention on how to estimate regression models for discrete outcomes including binary, categorical, and count variables. We use both frequentist and Bayesian methods to estimate a series of generalized linear models. These flexible tools allow us to more accurately model a wide range of outcomes.

## Communication

I've set up a Slack page for us to communicate about the course. This can be a resource for you to collaborate and ask me questions about homework, and will also be a spot where course announcements are posted. Invites will be circulated before the course begins.

## Course goals

1. Master data analysis with linear and generalized linear regression models
2. Develop expertise in advanced statistical programming and data visualization 
3. Develop the ability to design and conduct quantitative criminological research
4. Become familiar with advanced techniques, like multilevel modeling and missing data analysis

## Expectations

- Come prepared. This is a relatively small and advanced course. I expect everyone to participate actively in course discussions.

- Please complete and submit assignments on time. 

- Be respectful and professional. Be mindful of the space you take up in the classroom.

- Collaborate with your colleagues. I encourage you all to work together to complete assignments. However, I do expect you each to submit your own homework writeups. 

## Prerequisites

A prior graduate-level course in statistics is required. This course assumes students are comfortable with multivariate linear regression, basic probability, and statistical computing.

### Review resources

These [math camp](https://github.com/math-camp/course) materials from UChicago neatly cover the math you need for graduate-level statistics courses.

Jenny Bryan's [STAT 545](http://stat545.com/) course at UBC provides a very comprehensive overview of programming in R and efficient data science workflows.

## Software

All instruction will be conducted in the R statistical programming language. R is free and open-source, and can be downloaded [here](https://cran.r-project.org/).

We will be using the [RStudio integrated development environment](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). RStudio provides a powerful text editor and a range of very useful utilities. 

In addition to writing code, it is a great tool for writing reports, papers, and slides using [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html). This syllabus, most of my course materials, and most of my academic papers are based on Markdown and occasionally [LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes). I strongly recommend that you use RStudio and RMarkdown to complete course assignments.  

Lastly, I recommend learning some form of version control to ensure your work is a) backed up, b) easily accessible to collaborators and c) reproducible. Git and GitHub are great and flexible tools for software development that have powerful applications for researchers. Here's a useful [intro to GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/) for R users.

## Book

Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari,  *Regression and other stories* is our textbook. It provides a cutting edge introduction to applied statistical analysis with regression models. 

These books are also very useful, and some examples are pulled from them:

Wickham, [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) 

Healy, [*Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction*](http://socviz.co/index.html) 

McElreath, *Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan*

## Assignments and grading

Course grading is based on a combination of homework assignments (80 percent) and DataCamp completion (20 percent)

### Homework

- DataCamp: DataCamp provides interactive lessons in programming, and features a great library of R courses. I've set up a free account for all students in this course. I will assign DataCamp courses throughout the semester to push our programming skills forward. These assignments should typically take 4-8 hours (can be split easily into multiple sessions), and you will generally have two weeks to complete them. These will be completed entirely online through our course page on DataCamp. 

- Problem sets: I will assign a weekly selection of homework problems from the Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari book. These assignments should be completed in RMarkdown and submitted to our TA via email by the beginning of the next week's lecture.
