## Question 1

For this problem, we will use data built into R. Load the data using the console command data("anscombe"). 

- Describe the relationships between y1 and x1, y2 and x2, y3 and x3, and y4 and x4 in sequence using a correlation coefficient. 

- Construct linear regression models for each pair. Describe your results.

- Draw a scatterplot for each pair

- Summarize your findings

## Question 2

Use the data in revenue_dat.csv in the course repository (github.com/f-edwards/intermediate_stats/data/). 

1. Load in the data with read_csv(). 

2. Create a new data frame that subsets the data using select() to only the following columns: fips_st, fips_cnty, pop_tot, rev_prop_tax, pop_pct_deep_pov

3. Use the mutate() function in the dplyr package to construct a new variable for property tax revenue per capita called prop_tax_pc using the variables rev_prop_tax and pop_tot

4. Run a linear regression model with the proportion of the population in deep poverty (pop_pct_deep_pov) as an outcome and property tax revenues per capita (prop_tax_pc) as a predictor. 

5. Interpret your findings from the regression model. Explain the meaning of the coefficients as well as the real-world meaning of the relationship you've modeled. Length should be 1-2 paragraphs.
