4. Visualize the how this ratio of national GDP to global GDP variable varies across continents and over time. You may need to summarize the data first.

5. Estimate a regression model with average life expectancy as the outcome. Choose theoretically appropriate predictors. Explain your decisions. Explain your findings with tables or visuals as appropriate.
