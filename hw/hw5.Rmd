## Homework 5

Who was most (and least) likely to die on the Titanic? Use `./data/titanic.csv` for this one.

```{r setup, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
library(rstan)
library(rstanarm)
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores())
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE)

titanic<-read_csv("./data/titanic.csv")
```

## 1. Suggest a model 

We are modeling survival as the outcome.

- Explain a theory: what do we think affected risk of death

- Write out a logistic regression to evaluate your theory

2. Fit and evaluate the model

3. Think about revising the model

4. Compare model fits using posterior predictive checks and leave one out cross validation

5. Interpret the model, include simulations of probability of death in your interpretations
